# My ergodox keyboard layouts

I've have used ErgoDox Infinity for many years and have used this
repository to transfer the keyboard layout configuration between my
home keyboard and work keyboard.

But now I have got myself an ErgoDox EZ-compatible device from
falba.tech.

So now the repository have been repurposed to contain both of these
layouts.
